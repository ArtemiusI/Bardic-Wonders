  SAY ~DARKBLOOM BARD: Rarely seen in the Realms, Darkbloom Bards are recognized for their skills in using the powers of nature. Unlike druids, however, Darkbloom Bards appear to twist the beauty of flora and fauna into wicked and twisted visions—the stuff of eldritch dreams and nightmares. While some believe these are borne of the alien fantasies of practitioners, others fear that Darkbloom Bards are, in fact, drawing upon pieces of otherworldly aberrations that are attempting to infiltrate the waking world.

ADVANTAGES: 

– +15 bonus to Lore.
– +5% bonus to Magic Resistance.
– Receives one additional spell slot per spell level.
– +2 bonus to Armor Class vs Spectral Undead, Shadows, Myconids, Shambling Mounds, Shriekers, Slimes and Spectres.
– Receives the following druidic spells, which are automatically scribed into their spellbook: Curse, Beast Claw, Mold Touch, Thorn Spray, Insect Plague, Fire Seeds, Mist of Eldath.

– The Darkbloom Bard's song, "Silence of Dreamrealm's Bog", inflicts Silence upon all surrounding creatures, both friendly and hostile, as well as reducing Magic Resistance by 10% plus an additional 2% per two levels, up to a maximum of 50%. All creatures may make a Saving Throw vs. Spells at +2 (-1 modifier per 6 levels) to avoid being Silenced.

– 6th level: May use Dark Entanglement once per day.

DARK ENTANGLEMENT: By means of this spell, the caster is able to cause dark plants and roots in the area of effect to entangle creatures within the area. Once per round, a creature can attempt to make a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a +3 bonus to avoid entanglement. An entangled creature can still attack but receives a -2 penalty to its Armor Class and -10% to Magic Resistance. There is 10% chance upon entanglement that the creature will be poisoned and suffer 1 damage per second for 5 seconds.

– 12th level: May Backstab at x2 damage, additionally dealing 2d8 acid damage. There is also a 50% chance that the victim will be Entangled by dark vines for one round.

DISADVANTAGES:

– Incurs a -2 penalty to Strength and Constitution and a -4 penalty to Charisma.
– Incurs a -1 penalty to all Saving Throws.
– Only has one-quarter Pick Pockets percentage.
– May only be of True Neutral and Neutral Evil alignment.~

Level: 3

Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell infects the creature the caster touches with a rapidly spreading brown mold. If the infected creature fails a Save vs. Spell, the infection is severe and the creature takes magic damage as follows:

1st round: 4d6 damage
2nd round: 3d6 damage
3rd round: 2d6 damage
4th round: 1d6 damage

If the Saving Throw is successful, the damage is reduced as follows:

1st round: 2d6 damage
2nd round: 1d6 damage
3rd round: 1d6 damage

Each round after the first, the nearest creature within 10 ft. of the victim must make a Save vs. Spell or be infected by the mold at full strength. This process continues until the mold fails to infect a suitable host in time. Creatures already under the effects of the mold cannot contract it again. The brown mold quickly dies once the spell expires.~

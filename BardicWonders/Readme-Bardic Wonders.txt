Bardic Wonders - by Artemius I
==============================

This is what comes out of me having a bit of time to spare and messing with the game... I had this mod sitting in my file directory as a jumble of separate components for a while now and, since I had the time, I decided to combine it into an item pack + kit mod to share with everyone.

Bear in mind this mod's only marked as v0.1 because I might want to expand on it one day... I've played with the components for a while and they work quite well. Just remember that this was originally created for my own use so the balance isn't great. I'd rate the kit as being pretty stupid at high levels and the items as strong, but below Item Upgrades in strength.

============================
Component 1 - Troubadour Kit
============================

This component can be installed in either BG:EE or BG2:EE.

TROUBADOUR: Troubadours are musicians that specialize in lyric poetry. Their songs are often of chivalry and courtly love. In adventuring, troubadour bards are valuable due to their proficiency in healing spells, including songs of rejuvenation that protect their comrades. Women that choose the profession of the troubadour are usually known as trobaritz.

Advantages:

- May use the Bard Song "Song of Healing".

SONG OF HEALING: The troubadour's song gradually heals <PRO_HISHER> allies and provides them with resistance to any attempts to impair their movement, magical or otherwise.

1st Level: allies regenerate 1 hit point per round and are immune to slows.
9th Level: allies regenerate 2 hit points per round and are immune to all movement-impairing effects.
18th Level: allies regenerate 3 hit points per round and are immune to all mind-affecting and movement-impairing effects.

- Gains the following priest spells in their spellbook:

1st Level: Cure Light Wounds
2nd Level: Cure Medium Wounds
3rd Level: Remove Paralysis
4th Level: Cure Serious Wounds
5th Level: Cure Critical Wounds
6th Level: Mass Cure

- May cast spells while wearing armor.
- 10th Level: May use the Voice of Peace ability once per day.

VOICE OF PEACE: Chanting a soft melody, the troubadour soothes <PRO_HISHER> allies' spirits and renews their confidence, healing them for 1d6 (+1 per level) hit points. All allies affected also gain 10% physical resistance and immunity to berserk effects for 1 turn. However, allied barbarians and berserkers will find themselves unable to call upon their rage while the aura of calm is in effect.

Disadvantages:
- May not wear armor heavier than studded leather.
- May only be proficient in weapons usable by thieves.
- Only has one-half normal Lore value.
- Only has one-half Pick Pockets percentage
Pick pockets ability one-half normal.
- May only be of Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, True Neutral or Chaotic Neutral alignment.

Regarding the Troubadour: I honestly have no idea how this kit came to be. This was an original design with no particular basis, but the intention was to make a bard that could double as a healer and support with a powerful defensive bard song.

Admittedly, the song is pretty bonkers, especially at high levels. Unfortunately this is because regeneration doesn't work well with bard songs and can only be implemented as 'heal X damage per round' so it's at a much higher rate than I'd like it. On the other hand, it's less useful in combat than expected because it's using the nerfed bard song range and its overpoweredness really depends on how much you like to hammer that Rest button.

The reason the troubadour gets to wear armor is... well, I dunno. I prefer bards to wear leather over chain mail or nothing, I guess. With the advantages/disadvantages, the troubadour has a good variety of armor but can't wear some of the best late-game options.

========================
Component 2 - Item Pack
========================

This component can only be installed in BG2:EE. It adds a dozen new items, mostly intended for bards although a couple can also be used by other classes.

All items can be bought at Trademeet from a new merchant, Leanne the bard. Additionally, the PC can purchase one of two legendary weapons only usable by bards for a very high price. In order for her to offer these weapons, the PC must have an 'extreme' reputation (i.e. 20 or 1 reputation). If the PC is a bard, Leanne will offer the weapons at a significant discount, albeit the end cost is still pricey.

The Item Pack adds the following items to the game:
 - Unseen +4 (short sword)
 - Armor of the Grey Fox +3 (leather armor)
 - Resonating Shield +1 (buckler)
 - Harp of Tranquility (casts Eldath's Mist 1x/day)
 - Haven Lute (casts Otiluke's Resilient Sphere 3x/day)
 - Dancing Heels (boots)
 - Silence (amulet)
 - Cacophonic Voice +4 (halberd)
 - Whispering Links +2 (chain mail)
 - Cloak of the Wild Singer (cloak)

Leanne's two legendary weapons:
 - Dirge +5 (long sword)
 - Lament +5 (shortbow)

Jester's Chain for Jesters: The Jester's Chain is massively disappointing for two major reasons. One, its intended users, jesters, can't wear it very well due to it disabling casting. Two, it's pretty garbage, especially for the number of tokens you need to give up to acquire it. This is a major error that must be fixed. The improved jester's chain no longer disables spellcasting and provides a jester with an armor class bonus vs. missile weapons. However, the armor may be unpredictable - the wearer has a small chance to cause a wild surge with any spell they cast while wearing the armor. Fortunately, jesters gain a slight edge by having the protection of a Chaos Shield.

Also, the armor is now significantly more colorful. No self-respecting jester would settle for less.

==============================================================
Component 3 - Garrick the Troubadour (requires Troubadour kit)
==============================================================

This component gives Garrick the Troubadour kit, turning him from a somewhat below average bard to a consistently useful healer.

For reasons that should be obvious, I would not recommend installing this with any other mod that changes Garrick's class or kit. Hopefully, the script that does the work in the background will only trigger if Garrick is a regular, unkitted bard, but... bad things have been known to happen.

===============
Final Comments
===============

It was kind of a shame to watch these bits and pieces sit there and gather dust. It might not be the most inspired or exciting mod out there, but I hope it'll be fun to try out regardless.

  SAY ~Troubadour~
  SAY ~Troubadour~
  SAY ~TROUBADOUR: Troubadours are musicians that specialize in lyric poetry. Their songs are often of chivalry and courtly love. In adventuring, troubadour bards are valuable due to their proficiency in healing spells, including songs of rejuvenation that protect their comrades. Women that choose the profession of the troubadour are usually known as trobairitz.

Advantages:

- May use the Bard Song "Song of Healing".

SONG OF HEALING: The troubadour's song gradually heals <PRO_HISHER> allies and provides them with resistance to any attempts to impair their movement, magical or otherwise.

1st Level: allies regenerate 1 hit point per round and are immune to slows.
9th Level: allies regenerate 2 hit points per round and are immune to all movement-impairing effects.
18th Level: allies regenerate 3 hit points per round and are immune to all mind-affecting and movement-impairing effects.

- Gains the following priest spells in their spellbook:

1st Level: Cure Light Wounds
2nd Level: Remove Paralysis
3rd Level: Cure Medium Wounds
4th Level: Cure Serious Wounds
5th Level: Cure Critical Wounds
6th Level: Mass Cure

- May cast spells while wearing armor.
- 10th Level: May use the Voice of Peace ability once per day.

VOICE OF PEACE: Chanting a soft melody, the troubadour soothes <PRO_HISHER> allies' spirits and renews their confidence, healing them for 1d6 (+1 per level) hit points. All allies affected also gain 10% physical resistance and immunity to berserk effects for 1 turn. However, allied barbarians and berserkers will find themselves unable to call upon their rage while the aura of calm is in effect.

Disadvantages:
- May not wear armor heavier than studded leather.
- May only be proficient in weapons usable by thieves.
- Only has one-half normal Lore value.
- Only has one-half Pick Pockets percentage.
- May only be of Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, True Neutral or Chaotic Neutral alignment.~

Bystanders of battles involving a wielder of this weapon have claimed that the horrible cacophony from the weapon can enough to pulverize one's foe into a pulp... and sometimes oneself as well. Fortunately for would-be wielders, one of this halberd's former owners had the wisdom to enchant it with a protective enchantment as a safety precaution.
